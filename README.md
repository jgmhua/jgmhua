## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Jessica Hua, a beginner software developer with a passion for biomedical engineering and creating things with electronics.
This profile was created so I could keep a record of my projects and share my progress/work as I develop my skills and explore/attempt different projects! 

Currently, I am:
- continuing to work on Companionate; a skills-sharing platform/app that was my capstone project for the [Software Engineering boot camp at BrainStation](https://brainstation.io/online/software-engineering-bootcamp)
- starting up a new project (deciding between 2 projects at the moment!)

Feel free to checkout my repos and contact me for access to any of them! 

Also, I love collaborating, so please feel free to reach out for any project collaboration! ðŸ˜Š
ðŸ“« You can reach me: 
- here!
- through my email: jhua@live.ca or jesshua.notsnailmail@gmail.com,
- or through my [LinkedIn](www.linkedin.com/in/jessica-gm-hua).
